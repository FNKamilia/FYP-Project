Cash payment only. Coming at 7.20pm, restaurant are full house. Waiting for our food are roughly 25minutes after ordering at 7.30pm. The gang guong noodles are kampungs noodles served with fried lohbak, a few slices instead of roasted pork. Noodles comes with side soup with 3fish ball. Taste wise are very normal dried noodles with dark soya sauce and shallot oil. The wanton soup comes with 10 very little filling wanton served with loh mee soup + Assam laksa soup are named after lohlak. It’s light soup with a hint of sour Assam laksa soup. They served with a few strips of brown squid, in the soup. Well I guess Sitiawan people like little filling wantanFood are generally good, no msg or salty at all. Suitable for young kids and older people. My favorite dish are the Long yan. The noodles are chewy, gooey and smooth. As the noodles are made of tapioca powder and egg. Loh mee are nice too as the soup are filled with a lot brown squid, bamboo shoots and it goes well with some homemade garlic vinegarWill return to try their red wine chicken soup available only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The long yan noodles are really good and would like to have it againShow less'"
