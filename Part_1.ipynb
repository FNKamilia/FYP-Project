      "今天我和朋友家人长辈总共7个人在晚上9点多来这个地方打算看风景放松心情。在我们从电梯里出来要转进去这个餐厅的时候（基本上是在电梯外面），一位马来招待员走过来双手打开把我们挡住。 她说：“why are you here?”虽然当下觉得很奇怪，可是我们还是回答她说：“we are here for the sky bar”. 她：“is anyone of u going to buy at least one drink?” （她是用手指着我们说这一句话，我是慢半拍的人，当下也可以感受到她的不友善和瞧不起人的态度）当下的我们也来不及反应，也因为我们没有看到菜单，也不懂里面到底有什么可以吃还是喝的，而且我们当下也不是每个人都可以喝酒。我们和她说“no...”她：“you all minimum have to buy at least one drink then only can enter.”然后她就直接把我们晾在一边，完全没有要招待我们的意思。我们当下是很惊讶也不懂为什么她会这样对我们 我们每个人都很失望不能进去这个点评不错的地方。给管理层的建议，食物再好，服务员的素质也是很重要。 就算我们当下进去了这个餐厅，有这样的服务员，呈上的食物再好也是会被扣分！最重要的是，这个服务员表现出这个餐厅只服务喝酒消费的人。其他喝果汁饮料吃东西看风景的顾客就滚一边？真的要好好检讨一下！Show less\n",

Отдельно отмечу, что мы были первыми посетителями, но в кафе было грязно. Столики в пятнах каких то напитков, пол грязный. В один из двух туалетов просто противно входить. Далековато добираться. Из центра мы ехали на такси почти сорок минут. Кафе рекомендую только для фотосессий. Покушать - не сюда. Если мой отзыв был полезен - ставьте пальчик вверхShow less\n",

      "The restaurant is located in the Seven Terraces Hotel. The atmosphere is very good, the decoration is very beautiful, the waiter is very kind, and the corresponding corresponds.The food tastes very good. Both the pre -dishes, the main dishes, and the dessert are excellent and very distinctive. I like their curry shrimp and fish very much. The dessert's Pana Cotta also surprised me.Look at Nyonya Caifu.\n",

      "Laksa is an unusual food that can only be tasted in Penang.If you look at other people's reviews, it's similar to tuna kimchi jjigae, but it's really right.But when mint enters and chews vegetables, the mint scent suddenly comes up.(I liked mint so I ate deliciously.) The noodles were really good. The boss was so kind and always smiling.Last! Laksa is unique in penang.The Taste is Simily to Korean Food Kimchi Stew.The main menu has only one laksa.The Sell Several Kinds of Drinks.The boss is very friendly and always smiling to make you feel like.show Less\n",
